This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library("tidyverse")

```
```{r}
data("faithful")
?faithful
```

####Plot 1
```{r}
data(trees)
?trees
trees
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = trees)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Height, y=Girth))
```
#This scatterplot isn't as linear as I would expect.  I thought that girth and height would be more directly proportional.
####Plot2
```{r}
data("lynx")
?lynx
```

```{r}
data("lynx")
year <- c(1821:1934)
pelts <- as.vector(lynx)
lynx_pelts <- data.frame(year, pelts)
ggplot(data = lynx_pelts)+
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=year, y=pelts), color="maroon")
```
#Interesting representation.  It appears that the population of lynxes crashes multiple times, in a cyclical way.  I wonder if over hunting causes the crashes, then it takes several years for the population to recover, or if there were some hunting restrictions in place.  Although, given the dates, 1800s through early 1900s, I would think there were few to no restrictions.

####Plot 3
```{r}
data(iris)
?iris
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width), size=2)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=Species, shape=Species))+
  xlab("Petal Length")+
  ylab("Petal Width")

```
#Not knowing much about Iris species, it appears that virginica has significantly larger petal length and width than setosa.  Versicolor appears to be more similar in size to virginica.

####Plot 4 and 5
```{r}
data(msleep)
?msleep
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=vore, y=sleep_rem))+
  geom_violin(fill="grey30")

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=vore, y=sleep_rem))+
  geom_violin(fill="grey70")
```
#The two violin plots display several ranges of information. The longest part of the plot represents the entire range of responses where as the width of the plot shows the mode.  The fill is set to 30 then 70 which adjusts the darkness of the plot.  I am wondering if the fill range could be adjusted to show variation within the shape based on the density of the responses.  

####Plot 7  (no 6 is listed)
```{r}
data(msleep)
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=order, y=sleep_total))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```
#From the plotted data, it appears that some orders, such as carnivora, and rodentia have huge sleep requirements while other orders, such as Lagomorpha, rabbits, have extremely low sleep requirements. wow.  

####Plot 8
```{r}
data(msleep)
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=conservation, y=awake, color=conservation))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_jitter()+
  xlab("Conservation")+ylab("Awake")+
  guides(color=guide_legend(title = "Conservation"))
```
#I liked the chart without the coordinate flip.  It doesn't seem like there is any obvious correlation between endangered status and the amount of time the mammal is awake per day.

####Plot 9 and 10

```{r}
data("msleep")
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=sleep_total, y=bodywt, color=vore))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~vore, nrow=2)+
  xlab("Body Weight")+ylab("Sleep Total")+
  guides(color=guide_legend(title = "Vore"))
  
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x=sleep_total, y=brainwt, color=conservation))+
  geom_point()+
  xlab("Sleep Total")+ylab("Brain Weight")+
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Conservation"))+
  coord_flip()
```
#In graph 1, there are very few mammals that weigh over 1000 kg. This skews the scale and makes it more difficult to read.  If I had more time, I might look up a way to make the scale more logarithmic so the lower values could be seen more accurately.  In graph 2, it appears that there is a cluster of mammals that require between 8-12 hours of sleep every day.  It also appears that larger animals with larger brains generally require less sleep than smaller ones. Again, the relative scarcity of brainwts that are over 1 kg means that the values of the smaller brainwts are harder to see because the scale is skewed.  Again, a logarithmic scale might help with that problem.  (and I'm sure that can be done...)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
