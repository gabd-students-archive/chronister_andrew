```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
anscombe
```

```{r}
ansc <- 
  bind_cols(
    anscombe %>% 
      select(matches("x")) %>% 
      gather(dataset, "x"),
    anscombe %>% 
      select(matches("y")) %>% 
      gather(key, "y")
  ) %>% 
  select(-key) %>% 
  mutate(dataset = gsub("x", "", dataset)) %>% 
  as_tibble()

ansc
```


```{r}
ansc %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    stdev_x = sd(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    stdev_y=sd(y)
  )
```

```{r}
ansc %>%  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 2)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(xtable)

```

```{r}
head(iris)
```

```{r}
kable(head(iris),
      align= c("l", "c", "r", "c", "l"),
      col.names = c("Sepal Length", "Sepal Width", "Sepal Length", "Sepal Width", "Species"))

#I accidently read the l's as 1's and it took way too long for me to figure it out.  Need some new glasses!!! :D
```

```{r}
head(airquality)
```

```{r}
kable(head(airquality),
      align= c("r", "r", "c", "l", "l"),
      col.names = c("Ozone (ppb)", "Solar R (lang)", "Wind (mph)", "Temp (FÂ°)", "Month", "Day"))
```

```{r}
chicks_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)

summary(chicks_lm)
```

```{r}
kable(chickwts)
```

#when running kable on chickwts, there are two columns, grouped by the type of feed.  This is difficult to analyze, especially since it is not visible at the same time and requires scrolling.

```{r}
xtable(chicks_lm) %>%  kable()
```

```{r}
summary(trees)

```



```{r}
GirHeiTrees_lm <- lm(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)
summary(GirHeiTrees_lm)
```

```{r}
xtable(GirHeiTrees_lm) %>% kable()
```
#I may not get points for this, but better late than never!  My mistake.
