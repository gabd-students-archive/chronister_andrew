### [Fish Slapping Dance](https://youtu.be/T8XeDvKqI4E) ###
The fish slapping dance is a **hilarious** clip from the British comedy troupe *Monty Python*. Monty Python's humor was once considered "irreverent", but is relatively tame by today's standards. It accurately portrays my dry sense of humor. My love of British humor may stem from my love of British beer and British convertibles.
